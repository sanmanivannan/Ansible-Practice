Create an inventory file (add the IP address for each server on its own line)

 172.16.250.133
 172.16.250.134
Add the inventory file to version control
 git add inventory
Commit the changes
 git commit -m "first version of the inventory file, added three hosts."
Push commit to Github
 git push origin master
Test Ansible is working
 ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible -i inventory -m ping
Create ansible config file
 nano ansible.cfg
 
 [defaults]
 inventory = inventory
 private_key_file = ~/.ssh/ansible
Now the ansible command can be simplified
 ansible all -m ping
List all of the hosts in the inventory
 ansible all --list-hosts
Gather facts about your hosts
 ansible all -m gather_facts
Gather facts about your hosts, but limit it to just one host
 ansible all -m gather_facts --limit 172.16.250.132
